# Safe (Senior) Data Analyst - Home Exploration

Welcome to my submission for the **Senior Data Analyst** home exploration challenge. This repository contains solutions for analyzing Safe{Wallet} monetized swaps and wrangling synthetic smart contract event logs.

## 📊 Task 1: Revenue Analysis & Strategic Recommendations
![dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40cd340f-01e5-48b1-a156-dfe0e3901b63)

**Objective:** Assess the revenue generated by monetized swaps within Safe{Wallet}, analyze user behavior, and provide strategic recommendations on fee structures.

> **Note:** The full SQL query used to generate these insights is embedded directly within the Dune Dashboard queries.

### Summary of Insights
* **Strong Performance**: Safe's swap engine handles $247M volume with $319K revenue at 0.13% effective fee, competitive in DEX/aggregator markets; Native swaps excel in revenue efficiency, especially non-stable pairs.
* **User Segment Insights**: Sharks ($10K–$50K) show best revenue efficiency; Mega Whales ($1M+) are underpriced (0.07% fees); Fish (retail) are overpriced (0.28% fees) with low contribution.
* **Strategic Recommendations**: Adjust fees higher for whales, lower for retail; promote Native routes via incentives; target new traders; optimize SafeApp for high-volume paths like CoW/1inch to boost revenue.

## 🐍 Task 2: Python Data Wrangling Challenge

**Objective:** Analyze a dataset of ~20,000 synthetic smart contract events to detect anomalies, map user behavior, and clean data.

I have documented the approach, code structure, and findings for the Python challenge in the separate documentation linked below.

### Highlights of the Python Analysis

* **Project Focus**: Analyzes blockchain event data using Python for inconsistencies, patterns, and quality issues in `contract_events.csv`.
* **Key Discoveries**: Identified orphan events, precise time deltas between events, sender activity rankings, and data flaws like reused transaction hashes and unconfirmed references.
* **Anomalies Noted**: Extreme consistency in block intervals (mostly 15 seconds) points to potential synthetic or bot-generated data.
* **Outputs Generated**: CSV files for results and visualizations of event frequencies, contract distributions, statuses, and sender contributions in `output/` folder.
* **Execution**: Run via `python safe task.py`; relies on confirmed events for core reliability.
